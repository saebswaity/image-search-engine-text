### Image Search System Using Hugging Face Models and ChromaDB

**Objective:**  
Develop an image search engine as an alternative project to the main project "Speed Detection." This system leverages Hugging Face’s image-to-text models and ChromaDB for efficient and accurate image retrieval based on textual descriptions. Students can choose their own image database for this project. For commercial applications, a fashion dataset is recommended for its relevance to fashion stores.

**Steps:**

1. **Prepare Image Directory:**
   - **Input:** Directory containing images to be indexed.
   - **Action:** Ensure that all images are organized in a single directory for processing.

2. **Generate Text Captions:**
   - **Use:** Hugging Face's image-to-text pipeline.
   - **Action:** For each image in the directory, use the image-to-text model to generate a descriptive caption.
   - **Output:** Store each caption along with its corresponding image path in a text file. Organize these text files in a new directory, with each file containing information for one image.

3. **Store Information in ChromaDB:**
   - **Input:** Captions and their associated image paths.
   - **Action:** Convert each text caption into vector embeddings using a pre-trained model.
   - **Store:** Save the vector embeddings in ChromaDB, with each entry corresponding to an image caption.

4. **Search Functionality:**
   - **Input:** Text query (user’s search input).
   - **Process:**
     - Convert the text query into a vector embedding using the same model used for captions.
     - Match the query embedding with the stored embeddings in ChromaDB to find the closest matches.
   - **Output:** Retrieve and display the image paths of the most relevant images based on the textual query.

**Additional Notes:**
- This project serves as an alternative to the main "Speed Detection" project.
- Students are encouraged to select their own image database for the project. For a commercial application, a fashion dataset is recommended as it is particularly useful for fashion stores and related commercial uses.
- Implement error handling for cases where image captions might not be generated or embeddings may fail to store.
